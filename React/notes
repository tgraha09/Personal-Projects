npx create-react-app myfirstreact

Run app - cd myfirstreact

 npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd <app name>
  npm start
